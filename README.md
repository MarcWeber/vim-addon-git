I wrote a git interface to the git commands I use most often.
Enjoy.

Show all commands:

:*Git<c-d>

:StatusGit then :Help

That's should give you all info you need. If not contact me.
This code was taken from my tovl lib which got unmaintainable.


I should reference the other existing vim git scripts here. (TODO)
See www.vim.org

Tested on Linux only
